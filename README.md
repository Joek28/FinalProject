This project aims to analyze employee data to identify key factors influencing attrition and build a predictive model that can forecast which employees are most likely to leave the organization. By leveraging historical HR data (such as job role, department, satisfaction levels, income, and work-life balance), the goal is to provide actionable insights that support HR decision-making and improve employee retention strategies in a pharmaceutical setting.
